I am a PhD candiate at Monash University under the supervision of [Prof. Dinh Phung](http://dinhphung.ml/?i=1) and [Dr. Tu Dinh Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=4hT6E04AAAAJ&hl=en), working on applications of deep learning to natural language processing, knowledge graph embeddings and graph neural networks. Before that, I obtained my M.Sc in Language Science and Technology from Saarland University where I was a research assistant in the [Prof. Manfred Pinkal](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~pinkal/en/page.php)'s research group during my master study. Prior to that, I was a researcher and teaching assistant at the Faculty of Information Technology in the VNU University of Engineering and Technology where I obtained my BSc degree.
