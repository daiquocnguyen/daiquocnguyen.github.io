I am a Ph.D. candidate at Monash University, under the supervision of [Prof. Dinh Phung](http://dinhphung.ml) and [Dr. Tu Dinh Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4hT6E04AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), working on applications of deep learning to natural language processing, knowledge graph embeddings and graph neural networks. Before that, I obtained my M.Sc in Language Science and Technology from Saarland University, where I was a research assistant in [Prof. Manfred Pinkal](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~pinkal/en/page.php)â€™s research group. Prior to that, I was a researcher at VNU University of Engineering and Technology, where I received my B.Sc degree.
