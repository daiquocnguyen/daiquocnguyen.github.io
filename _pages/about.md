I am a PhD candiate at Monash University under the supervision of Prof. Dinh Phung and Dr. Tu Dinh Nguyen, working on applications of deep learning to natural language processing, knowledge graph embeddings and graph neural network. Before that, I obtained my MSc in Language Science and Technology from Saarland University where I was a research assistant in the Prof. Manfred Pinkal's research group during my master study. Prior to that, I was a researcher and teaching assistant at the Faculty of Information Technology in the VNU University of Engineering and Technology where I obtained my BSc degree.
